EXAMPLES

NOTE
    Several of the functions in this module contain a parameter named "fields",
    an array of strings which allows you to specifiy which properties of the
    returned object are visible.  The values that are passed to this parameter
    depend upon the box object type that the command is referencing.  I would
    recommend downloading the portable application ILSpy
    (https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) and opening the "box.v2.dll" assembly
    located in the "library" folder of this module.  Then, expand the tree view
    for the assembly to Box.v2.models, and this will contain all of the
    different box object types.  Just select one (eg. BoxFile) and the valid
    items you can include in the string array that you pass to the "fields"
    parameter can be shown for each box object.
